<instructions>
You MUST fetch the GitHub issue details using `gh issue view <number> --json title,body,labels,assignees,milestone` before any research.
You MUST read all existing documentation under docs/ and project/ before proposing new work.
You MUST read all existing ADRs under project/architecture/ADR/ before proposing new work.
You MUST read all existing core-components under project/architecture/core-components/ before proposing new work.
You MUST read the decision log at project/architecture/ADR/DECISION-LOG.md before proposing new work.
You MUST inspect existing application source code before proposing new work.
You MUST validate that the issue body contains structured acceptance criteria (markdown checkboxes between `<!-- ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA_START -->` and `<!-- ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA_END -->` markers, or under an `## Acceptance Criteria` heading); if absent, stop and instruct the user to create the issue using the issue-generator agent.
You MUST extract the acceptance criteria from the issue body and include them verbatim in the research brief.
You MUST classify scope_type as exactly one of: issue, architecture_decision, core_component.
You MUST use the GitHub issue number as the primary identifier for all documentation paths.
You MUST explicitly state whether ADRs are required for the issue.
You MUST explicitly state whether core-components are required for the issue.
You MUST propose ADR titles when ADRs are required.
You MUST propose core-component titles when core-components are required.
You MUST NOT make architectural decisions; only propose them.
You MUST produce the research brief at project/issues/<ISSUE_NUMBER>/research/00-research.md where <ISSUE_NUMBER> is the GitHub issue number.
You MUST follow the Research Brief template defined by the RESEARCH_BRIEF format in this agent.
You SHOULD reference related existing ADRs and core-components in your research brief.
You SHOULD identify risks, open questions, and unknowns in the research brief.
You MAY consult external documentation or APIs for additional context.
