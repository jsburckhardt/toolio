<instructions>
You MUST read the research brief at project/issues/<ISSUE_NUMBER>/research/00-research.md before any planning work.
You MUST read the ADR template at project/architecture/ADR/ADR-0001-template.md before creating any ADR.
You MUST read the core-component template at project/architecture/core-components/CORE-COMPONENT-0001-template.md before creating any core-component.
You MUST read the decision log at project/architecture/ADR/DECISION-LOG.md before creating any ADR or core-component.
You MUST read all existing ADRs under project/architecture/ADR/ before creating new ones.
You MUST read all existing core-components under project/architecture/core-components/ before creating new ones.
You MUST inspect application source code before creating tasks.
You MUST NOT create an architectural decision outside of an ADR document.
You MUST NOT create reusable cross-cutting behavior outside of a core-component document.
You MUST update project/architecture/ADR/DECISION-LOG.md for every ADR or core-component change.
You MUST record one or more decision records in the Decisions section of DECISION-LOG.md for every ADR or core-component created.
You MUST write each decision record as a short actionable statement that can be understood without opening the source document.
You MUST derive decision records from the concrete choices made in an ADR.
You MUST derive decision records from core-components by extracting each enforceable rule or behavioral contract.
You MUST start each decision statement with an imperative verb.
You MUST NOT write vague or aspirational decisions.
You MUST reference the source as the ADR or core-component ID.
You MUST treat ADRs and core-components as global artifacts not scoped to any issue.
You MUST follow the ADR template structure exactly when creating new ADRs.
You MUST follow the core-component template structure exactly when creating new core-components.
You MUST assign sequential ADR numbers using the pattern ADR-####-slug.md.
You MUST assign sequential core-component numbers using the pattern CORE-COMPONENT-####-slug.md.
You MUST create a Plan of Attack at project/issues/<ISSUE_NUMBER>/plan/01-action-plan.md for each issue where <ISSUE_NUMBER> is the GitHub issue number.
You MUST produce the task breakdown at project/issues/<ISSUE_NUMBER>/plan/02-task-breakdown.md.
You MUST produce the test plan at project/issues/<ISSUE_NUMBER>/plan/03-test-plan.md.
You MUST ensure every task has acceptance criteria.
You MUST ensure every task has explicit test coverage requirements.
You MUST ensure every task references relevant ADRs and core-components.
You SHOULD reference related existing ADRs when creating new ones.
You SHOULD order tasks by dependency so blocked tasks appear after their dependencies.
You SHOULD estimate relative complexity for each task.
You MAY split large tasks into smaller subtasks for clarity.

DECISION_GUIDANCE: TEXT<<
Purpose:
  The Decisions section is the central quick-reference for every concrete commitment
  made in the project. An agent or human reading only this table should know exactly
  what was decided, without opening any ADR or core-component.

Deriving decisions from an ADR:
  - Extract each chosen option or technology (1 decision per choice).
  - Extract each rejected alternative only if the rejection itself is a rule ("Prohibit ORM X").
  - Extract constraints introduced ("Limit request payload to 1 MB").
  - One ADR typically yields 1-4 decisions; never zero.

Deriving decisions from a core-component:
  - Extract each enforceable behavioral rule ("Require structured JSON logging on every service").
  - Extract each integration contract ("Authenticate all API calls via JWT bearer tokens").
  - One core-component typically yields 1-3 decisions; never zero.

Writing style:
  - Start with an imperative verb: Use, Require, Enforce, Adopt, Prohibit, Limit, Expose, etc.
  - Max ~15 words — just enough to be unambiguous.
  - No jargon without context ("Use Zod" is too vague; "Use Zod for runtime input validation" is good).
  - Must be verifiable: could a reviewer check this in a PR? If not, rewrite.

Good examples:
  - "Use Next.js App Router for all page routing" (ADR-0002)
  - "Adopt PostgreSQL as the primary data store" (ADR-0002)
  - "Require all API handlers to validate input with Zod schemas" (CORE-COMPONENT-0003)
  - "Enforce Conventional Commits on every commit message" (CORE-COMPONENT-0002)
  - "Prohibit direct database access outside the repository layer" (ADR-0005)

Bad examples (do NOT write these):
  - "We decided on a tech stack" — too vague, not actionable.
  - "Follow best practices for testing" — not specific, not verifiable.
  - "Consider using Redis" — aspirational, not a commitment.
