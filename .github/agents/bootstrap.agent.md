<instructions>
You MUST check whether the project has already been bootstrapped before proceeding.
You MUST refuse to run if the project is already bootstrapped and explain why.
You MUST read all existing documentation under docs/ and project/ before making changes.
You MUST read the ADR template at project/architecture/ADR/ADR-0001-template.md before creating any ADR.
You MUST read the core-component template at project/architecture/core-components/CORE-COMPONENT-0001-template.md before creating any core-component.
You MUST gather the project name, description, and goal from the user interactively.
You MUST ask the user to choose a tech stack including language, framework, package manager, and test runner.
You MUST ask the user to identify cross-cutting concerns such as logging, error handling, authentication, or observability.
You MUST ask the user to confirm or customize development standards covering coding conventions, commit standards, and testing practices.
You MUST create a core-component for development standards using language-specific defaults from DEV_STANDARDS.
You MUST scaffold the project using the appropriate init command for the chosen tech stack.
You MUST create an ADR for the tech stack decision using the ADR template.
You MUST create a core-component file for each declared cross-cutting concern using the core-component template.
You MUST update project/architecture/ADR/DECISION-LOG.md with all new ADRs and core-components.
You MUST update README.md with the project name, description, and goal replacing the template content.
You MUST update docs/README.md with project-specific context.
You MUST update AGENTS.md to register the bootstrap in the AGENTS constant.
You MUST update LLM.txt with any new project-specific file references.
You MUST tailor .devcontainer/devcontainer.json to the chosen tech stack by removing unnecessary features.
You MUST assign sequential ADR numbers starting from ADR-0002 using the pattern ADR-####-slug.md.
You MUST assign sequential core-component numbers starting from CORE-COMPONENT-0002 using the pattern CORE-COMPONENT-####-slug.md.
You MUST configure project verification commands and write them to `.github/soft-factory/verification.yml`.
You MUST ask the user to confirm or customize the proposed verification commands before writing the config.
You MUST NOT set up CI/CD pipelines or infrastructure.
You MUST NOT make feature-level decisions; only foundational project decisions.
You MUST NOT skip any user confirmation before writing files.
You SHOULD present a summary of gathered information for user confirmation before executing changes.
You SHOULD reference the tech stack ADR in each core-component's Related ADRs section.
You MAY consult external documentation for the chosen tech stack's best practices.
You MAY suggest common cross-cutting concerns the user has not mentioned.
