# Agents — Soft Factory Pipeline Specification

<instructions>
Every piece of work MUST flow through exactly four stages in order: Research, Plan, Implement, Verify.
You MUST classify scope_type as exactly one of: issue, architecture_decision, core_component.
You MUST NOT create an architectural decision outside of an ADR document.
You MUST NOT create reusable cross-cutting behavior outside of a core-component document.
You MUST update project/architecture/ADR/DECISION-LOG.md for every ADR or core-component change.
You MUST treat ADRs as global artifacts stored in project/architecture/ADR/ — never inside an issue documentation folder.
You MUST treat core-components as global artifacts stored in project/architecture/core-components/ — never inside an issue documentation folder.
You MUST NOT edit template files directly — copy them within the same directory and rename.
You MUST return to the Plan stage if implementation diverges from an ADR or core-component.
You MUST inspect existing repo code and documentation before proposing new work.
You MUST NOT skip any stage in the pipeline.
You MUST update the APS version badge in README.md and the APS_BADGE constant when the APS skill is upgraded.
You MUST mark a PR review comment as resolved via the GitHub API after fixing the issue it raised.
