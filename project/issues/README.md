# Issues

This directory contains per-issue documentation produced by the RPIV pipeline. Each subdirectory maps to a **GitHub Issue** by number.

## Canonical Structure

When an agent runs the pipeline for GitHub Issue `#42`, it creates:

```
project/issues/42/
  research/
    00-research.md          ← Research brief (scope classification, findings)
  plan/
    01-action-plan.md       ← Chosen approach, non-goals, acceptance criteria
    02-task-breakdown.md    ← Tasks with acceptance criteria and test requirements
    03-test-plan.md         ← Full test coverage requirements
  implementation/
    README.md               ← Implementation notes and decisions made during coding
```

## Conventions

- Subdirectory names are plain issue numbers (e.g., `42/`, not `WI-0042-slug/`)
- Agents create these directories automatically — do not create them manually
- ADRs and core-components are **global** and live under `project/architecture/`, never inside an issue folder
- Templates are defined in the agent specifications, not duplicated here

## Acceptance Criteria Format

Every GitHub issue **must** include structured acceptance criteria for the RPIV pipeline to process it. Use the `@issue-generator` agent to create properly formatted issues.

### Required format

Acceptance criteria must be formatted as markdown checkboxes wrapped with HTML comment markers:

```markdown
## Acceptance Criteria

<!-- ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA_START -->

**Core**
- [ ] Criterion one
- [ ] Criterion two

**Edge Cases**
- [ ] Edge case one

**Testing**
- [ ] Test requirement one

<!-- ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA_END -->
```

### Rules

- Exactly one `<!-- ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA_START -->` and one `<!-- ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA_END -->` marker
- Only `- [ ]` checkbox list items between the markers (plus optional group headings)
- The verifier agent validates each criterion and marks satisfied ones as `- [x]` in both the issue and the PR description
